# Solar Panel Degradation Modeling Demo (LEO)

Mini demo for the project:
**Solar Panel Degradation Modeling for LEO Satellites**

## Description
This demo implements a simplified solar array degradation model that combines:
- a constant yearly aging term
- an altitude-dependent radiation degradation proxy

The model computes the relative solar array power (P/P0) over a 10-year mission
for different Low Earth Orbit (LEO) altitudes.

## Model assumptions
- Constant degradation: 0.5% per year
  (represents combined effects such as UV exposure and atomic oxygen)
- Radiation degradation increases with altitude:
  - lower at 400 km
  - higher at 700 km
- The model is intentionally simplified and intended as a demonstration.

## Technologies used
- Python 3
- NumPy for numerical computation
- Matplotlib for plotting

## How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/degradation.py
